    <b>Difference Between Healthy Food and Unhealthy Food </b>
    <br>
    <p1>
        Healthy foods are derived or sourced naturally and are neither processed nor nutrient-deficient. Healthy foods provide the body with essential nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, fibres, proteins, and healthy carbohydrates and fats. These nutrients are crucial for the normal functioning of the body's metabolic needs.
        
        The difference between healthy vs unhealthy food, or junk food, lies in the nutritional value. Junk foods are high in processed sugars, fats, and calories, leading to various health problems. They are low in essential nutrients and offer almost no health benefits.
        
        When comparing health food vs. junk food, it's important to note that occasional consumption of junk foods may not necessarily be harmful, but a diet high in unhealthy foods can be detrimental to the body by increasing the chance of experiencing numerous health complications, including coronary artery diseases, excessive weight gain, obesity, and type-2 diabetes.
